      <p><em>Operations Coordinator for <strong><a href="https://www.huttie.com/">Huttie Building Services</a></strong></em></p>

      <p>I am a young professional living in Cambridge, with a background in mathematical and scientific research studies and work experience in fast paced logistics and customer services. My most recent role in operations has given me an extensive
        insight into the importance of collaborative working, as well as in depth scheduling and administrative skills. Colleagues would describe me as a highly motivated and personable individual who enjoys working in a team environment and learning
        from those around him. In addition, I embrace the opportunity to take ownership of projects with best practice and an open-mind. </p></td>
