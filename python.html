      <p>I have always had a fascination with the Mandelbrot set and its beauty. The non-divergent set was first conceived by Adrien Douady and named after Benoit Mandelbrot set, a pioneer of fractals. The complex fractal has gained a cult following due to its complexity, beauty and unique structure. There are many examples of animations displaying the self-similarity under magnification, videos exampling the set and even t-shirts. This project helped me brush off my Python cobwebs after taking some time off. I used numpyâ€™s linspace and meshgrid to define the complex space with a series of for loops and if statements to iterate and test each point in the space.</p>
